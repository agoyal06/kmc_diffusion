# kmc_diffusion

1. This repository contain python scripts and fortran codes
2. Python scritps	

"compute_msd.py" - To print out diffusivities and  mean square displacement (msd) vs. time from the output file obtained from a object oriented kMC code.
"KMC_run.py" - To submit many different kMC jobs on multiple nodes at once.

3. Fortran "code msd.f90" called by the python scropt "compute_msd.py" to compute mean square displacement.
